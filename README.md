# GitHub_SQL-Project
## Project Objective
This project focuses on end-to-end data processing using Python and SQL Server. Raw weather data was cleaned and transformed in Google Colab, then uploaded to SQL Server for structured querying and analysis. The project explores key metrics such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and visibility to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies that support weather-related decision-making.

## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/gomathimurthi199930/GitHub_SQL-Project/blob/main/WeatherHistory.csv"> view Dataset</a>

## Questions
- What is the average temperature for each month?
- Which day had the highest & lowest average temperature?
- What is the average Humidity and Wind speed
- How many days were above or below a certain temperature (35C)
- What are the top 10 hottest and coldest day?
- Is there a correlation between temperature and humidity?
- What is the temperature variation (difference between max and min temp) in each month?
- How many days had "Rainy" weather (based on weather_condition)?
- What is the average temperature for each type of weather condition?
- Which day(s) in April 2006 had the lowest visibility and what was the weather summary?

## Process
- Data Collection: Gathered raw weather data in CSV format.
- Data Cleaning: Used Python in Google Colab to clean and preprocess the data.
- Data Upload: Imported the cleaned data into SQL Server using import tools.
- Data Analysis: Executed SQL queries to analyze weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and visibility.
