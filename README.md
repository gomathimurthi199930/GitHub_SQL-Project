# GitHub_SQL-Project
## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to perform comprehensive analysis on weather data using SQL Server. The project explores key metrics such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and visibility to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies that support weather-related decision-making.

## Tool used
- SQL Server

## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/gomathimurthi199930/GitHub_SQL-Project/blob/main/WeatherHistory.csv"> view Dataset</a>

## Questions
- What is the average temperature for each month?
- Which day had the highest & lowest average temperature?
- What is the average Humidity and Wind speed
- How many days were above or below a certain temperature (35C)
- What are the top 10 hottest and coldest day?
- Is there a correlation between temperature and humidity?
- What is the temperature variation (difference between max and min temp) in each month?
- How many days had "Rainy" weather (based on weather_condition)?
- What is the average temperature for each type of weather condition?
- Which day(s) in April 2006 had the lowest visibility and what was the weather summary?

## Process
- Data Collection: Gathered raw weather data in CSV format.
- Data Cleaning: Used Python in Google Colab to clean and preprocess the data.
- Data Upload: Imported the cleaned data into SQL Server using import tools.
- Data Analysis: Executed SQL queries to analyze weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and visibility.

## Project Insights
- Monthly trends in temperature and humidity were identified using SQL queries.
- Extreme weather days (hottest, coldest, and lowest visibility) were effectively detected.
- Weather conditions were analyzed to find their effect on temperature and visibility.
- Discovered a moderate correlation between temperature and humidity levels.
- Cleaned data and structured storage in SQL Server enabled fast and accurate analysis.
