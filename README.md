# GitHub_SQL-Project
## Project Objective
This project focuses on end-to-end data processing using Python and SQL Server. Raw weather data was cleaned and transformed in Google Colab, then uploaded to SQL Server for structured querying and analysis. The project explores key metrics such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and visibility to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies that support weather-related decision-making.
